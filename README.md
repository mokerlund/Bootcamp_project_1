## Factors influencing the Opioid epidemic
### The opioid epidemic has made national news and is at the forefront of political policy currently. 
### But what do we actually know about it?  Taking one state as an example, we want to examine factors influencing the Opioid epidemic, attempting to answer the following questions:
* Who is impacted most by opioid addiction? 
* How do the following factors influence ED visits, hospitalizations or deaths:
1. Socioeconomic status?
2. Rural vs. Urban vs. Suburban
3. Gender
4. Education level
5. Age
6. Ethnicity
7. Crime
* How well do interventions currently being implemented impact ED visits, hospitalizations and deaths? 
* How do counties with these interventions compare to those without, and to the national averages?
* Number of treatment facilities in the county
* Use of Naloxone in police related interventions
* Suboxone prescriptions
* Medication drop boxes for disposal of excess controlled substances
***

***
## Outcome:
* Females tended to overdose more on prescription medication while men tended to overdose more on illegal substances.
